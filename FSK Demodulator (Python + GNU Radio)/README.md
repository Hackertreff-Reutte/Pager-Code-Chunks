This contains a file for GNU-Radio to receive data from a FSK modulated 
signal. This signal is then stored in a binary file.
And because binary files are quite hard to use the is also a python script 
that can read this binary file and print it as binary ASCII

eg: 0b1011 = "1011"

TODO: describe the files a bit more
