# BCH Generator

This is a simple programm to generate messages with a BCH checksum at the end.
It can also be used to verify the BCH checksum, but not to correct the codewords.

This program was an early attempt to verify the code used for the pager. 
If you want to see BCH code with a little bit inefficent code correction
you could take a look at the POCSAG-Pager repository.

This program does not serve any purpose at the time and is only here for documentation purposes.
