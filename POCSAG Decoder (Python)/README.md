This folder contains a python file that is capable of decoding pocsag messages.

You can feed this programm inverted pocssag messages and it will decodes it and
print the resulting message. But beware it does not have any functions 
to perform a bit correction. (BCH is just used for validity)

Eg input data "101010101010101010101010100101110101001010110...."
(for a real example see the comment at the end of the code)
